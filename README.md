# HDL Code Generation using LLMs
___

This research focuses on automating the generation of Verilog code (a hardware description language) using Large Language Models (LLMs). The motivation behind this project is to simplify and accelerate hardware design processes by leveraging AI-based tools. Specifically, the goal is to generate Verilog code either directly through LLMs or by converting Python code (derived from Verilog code) back into Verilog using tools like Pyverilog. This can significantly improve the productivity of engineers working on digital systems by providing a tool that can automate part of the design process, saving time and reducing human error.
